# Forcefields
LAMMPS compatible interatomic potentials

In this repository you will find a number of potentials for different materials. These potentials work with the LAMMPS simulation package using the QUIP pair style command. They can also be used in the ASE simulation environment.

In each directory corresponding to a material, you will find the .xml files corresponding to the potential, an example lammps input file which may be used, and an example initial configruation of whichever material the potential has been fit to. If you have any question or problems, please feel free to contact Samuel Tovey at:

or alteranatively,

What follows is a quikc summary of the families of materials which are found in this repository.
## Molten Salts
In this directory all of the forcefields for the molten salts will be added. Check the README in this directory for more information about using the potentials
